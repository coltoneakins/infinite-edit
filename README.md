# Infinite Edit

![Infinite Edit Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Infinite Edit** turns your VS Code workspace into an infinite, spatial canvas. Break free from tabs and organize your code the way you think.

## Features

### 🌌 Infinite Canvas
Navigate your codebase on a 2D infinite plane. Pan and zoom freely to organize your thoughts and files spatially.

### 📄 Spatial Editing
Open files directly onto the canvas. Each file becomes a node that you can drag, arrange, and group logically.

### ✏️ Seamless Integration
-   **Open Files**: Use the command `Infinite Edit: Open File` to open your current active editor onto the canvas.
-   **Full Editing**: Edit code with full syntax highlighting (powered by CodeMirror) directly on the canvas.
-   **Save**: Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S`) within a node to save changes back to your disk instantly.

## Getting Started

1.  Install the extension.
2.  Run the command `Infinite Edit: Open Canvas` to launch the infinite workspace.
3.  Open any file in VS Code, then run `Infinite Edit: Open File` to add it to the canvas.
4.  Drag nodes by their title bar to arrange them.
5.  Scroll to zoom, drag the background to pan.

## Requirements

-   VS Code 1.90.0 or higher.

## Known Issues

-   Currently supports single-file nodes.
-   Resizing nodes is coming soon.
